# password-generator-js

## Description

This project is a password generator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The motivation behind building this project was to provide a simple yet secure solution for generating passwords with different combinations of characters, lengths, and criteria that users can customize according to their preferences.

The problem it solves is the common issue of weak passwords that are easy to guess, leaving user accounts vulnerable to hacking attempts. With this application, users can generate strong, random passwords that meet specific criteria, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Through building this project, I learned about various JavaScript concepts, such as functions, arrays, loops, and conditional statements, and how they can be used to create interactive web applications.
